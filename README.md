# carparksapp

This app is a proof of concept prototype written using the MEAN stack.

The application allows for the reservation of carparks for a company based on
criteria from the back end mongodb.  Carpark types are set by status, either
reserved, free or taken.  A reserved carpark can be released for use by the
general public when free'd up by the carpark owner, noted by the label assigned
in the back end database.

The database is not provided in this code base, only the node.js implementation
